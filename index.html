            <h1>Charity.</h1>
            <p>
                Sheeran performed a gig in Bristol, which raised £40,000 for a charity that reaches out to street sex workers. </p>
                <blockquote>"There's a lot more popular charities that get a lot of attention. And with certain subjects like this they're 
                often washed over and people don't necessarily give them the attention they deserve." <cite>—Ed Sheeran</cite></blockquote>
                <p>Sheeran also frequently 
                gives away his clothes to charity shops around his home county Suffolk. On 15 November 2014, Sheeran joined the 
                charity supergroup Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the 
                track "Do They Know It's Christmas?" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the Ebola 
                virus epidemic in West Africa. In November 2015, Sheeran supported the No Cold Homes campaign by the UK charity, 
                Turn2us.
